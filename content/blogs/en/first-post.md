Modern restaurants increasingly deploy self-service kiosks to improve throughput, order accuracy, and average ticket size.

## Benefits

- Higher conversion at peak
- Fewer order errors
- Visual menus improve attachment rate

> Teams usually start with 1-2 kiosks per entrance and iterate.

## Metrics

Track: line time, conversion, attachments, and overall throughput.

```ts
type Metric = {
  name: string
  value: number
}
```
